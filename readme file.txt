This is my Quarterly Stock Data Analysis. Using VBA I was able to read a large amount of stock data and calculate the quarterly change, percent change and total stock volume of every stock included. Using that analysis I was able to calculate the greatest % increase, greatest % decrease and the greatest total stock volume. In the files included the file labeled VBA Code is the source code that did my analysis, the 4 screenshots are the results from the analysis for each individual quarter and this is the readme file explaining the whole project.
